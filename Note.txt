Note:

This application is a simple tictactoe game with dynamic dimensions. but in this game only contains logic or only on the console. why not built web based. in accordance with the requirements
this game is made using java web. in my opinion it is very difficult to implement. because making a dynamic board according to user input is very difficult or impossible if
only use web (jsp) and java. although on the web (jsp) using javaScript to create dynamic boards but can not communicate with java. because of java and javaScript
are 2 different server side technologies.
maybe it is better implemented using javaScript and Html only.
because of that this game is made only as a console in java but it can implement dynamic board dimensions. Thank you for your attention
